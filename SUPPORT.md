Cybersecurity Blog Posts uses GitHub to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and associated
patches because GitHub now provides enough adequate tooling for its community.
Patches can be submitted as pull requests, but if you don't create an issue,
it's unlikely that we'll notice your contribution or accept it. Please make sure you
document your contributions well enough for us to understand the changes.
