LIST OF ARTICLES AND CURRENT COPIED STATUS
==========================================

Here is a list of the articles over on the main Cybersecurity blog, and their corresponding copied status. If the status column contains a green tick, this means the article has already been copied over from the main website. If the status column contains a red cross, this means the article has not yet been copied over form the main website.

**_Important Notice:_**
_You must make sure you not only check this list of article status indicators, but also the comments within the main [Copy Article Task Issue](# "Cybersecurity Blog Articles - ProfCyberNaught - Copy Article Task - GitHub Issue") to make sure nobody has stated they are currently copying your chosen article already._

<br />

**Representations of Backup Status:**<br />
A tick :heavy_check_mark: represents the article has already been copied over to this backup repository.

A cross :x: represents the article still needs copying over as a backup.<br /><br />

**FAQ: Why are some done and not others? (seems random)**
<br />Contributors who are new to GitHub are welcome to copy an article over from the main Cybersecurity website to this backup repository. This means, _you are free to choose which article you would like to copy over_. Being a beginner friendly repository task, the shorter, less complex articles get chosen first by contributors on most occassions due to the learning process. This can result in a random copied status. I try suggest contributors challenge and stretch themselves when choosing an article to backup.<br />

**FAQ: What does the 'contains' data mean?**
<br />The 'contains' line under each article name displays the different types of data elements within the cybersecurity article. This will help contributors understand the potential complexity, and potential time needed to copy that article and make the backup copy in this repository. You could call it an 'indicator of difficulty level' for those who are new to the GitHub platform.<br />I even coded a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript page to help me generate the content data types called: [content_types_script.html](./content_types_script.html "Content Types Script - Assistance Code - ProfCyberNaught")<br /><br />

**The following table also represents the order in which the Cybersecurity articles were published on the main website.**
