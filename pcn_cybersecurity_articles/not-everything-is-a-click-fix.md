The term **"click fix"** refers to the idea that many non-technical people assume that any problem related to technology can be easily solved with just a few clicks. This is a play on the phrase **"quick fix,"** which implies that a problem can be solved quickly and easily. The term 'click fix' is generally used in either photography for taking photos, or construction to enable a click-fix mechanism to attach two objects (essentially, in a quick manner). Prof Cyber Naught uses this term and relates it to the area of consumer understanding within the technical support industry.

Many non-technical or non-IT peeps seem to have the understanding, just because somebody works in tech, they know how to fix things quickly. Instructions would go along the lines of... just a click here, just a click there... and DONE! In some simple scenarios, this can be the exact case.

However, this is *often not* the case. Many issues related to technology are complex and cannot be resolved with just a few clicks. They may require extensive troubleshooting, programming, or even a complete redesign or reboot of the system.

Non-technical people need to understand that technology professionals are not magicians who can make problems disappear with the click of a button. Many times, resolving a technical issue requires a significant amount of time and expertise.

Additionally, it's important for technology professionals to communicate effectively with non-technical people and to set realistic expectations about the time and effort required to fix a problem.

In short, not everything is a "click fix" in the world of technology and both technical and non-technical individuals need to understand and accept this reality.
