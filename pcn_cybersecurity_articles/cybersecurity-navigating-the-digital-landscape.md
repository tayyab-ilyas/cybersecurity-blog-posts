As we continue to rely more and more on technology in our everyday lives, the importance of cybersecurity becomes increasingly clear. From online banking to social media, our personal and professional lives are stored in digital form, making us vulnerable to cyber attacks. But what exactly is cybersecurity and how can we protect ourselves?

Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting internet-connected systems, including hardware, software, and data, from attack, damage, or unauthorised access. This includes protecting against a wide range of threats, such as viruses, malware, and hacking.

One of the most important steps in protecting ourselves is to be aware of the common methods used by cybercriminals. Phishing scams, for example, involve sending emails or messages that appear to be from a legitimate source, such as a bank or government agency, in an attempt to trick the recipient into providing personal information. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the victim's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key.

To protect ourselves from these and other threats, there are several steps we can take:

- Keep your software and operating system up to date: Software updates often include security patches that address vulnerabilities.
- Use a strong and unique password for each of your accounts (stored in a password manager) and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks (if you must, try connect through a VPN for added privacy)
- Be cautious when clicking on links or opening attachments from unknown sources (this is the quickest way to malware and ransomware)
- Back up important files and data regularly (even cloud services advise you to do this)
- Use a reputable antivirus software (don't disable it if a program asked you whilst installing)
- Be aware of the risks and educate yourself about the latest scams and threats (educate your friends and family)

It's also important to note that cybersecurity is not just an individual responsibility, but a shared one. Businesses and organisations have a responsibility to protect their customers' and employees' personal information and should have a robust cybersecurity plan in place.

In conclusion, cybersecurity is a critical concern in today's digital age. By being aware of the common methods used by cybercriminals, taking steps to protect ourselves, and working together as a community, we can navigate the digital landscape with confidence and protect ourselves and those around us from cyber attacks.
